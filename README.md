# godash

Modeled after the [lodash](https://lodash.com/) library, godash is a collection of useful functions for working with
slices/arrays, maps, sets, hashable sets, optionals and more. It is meant to help you write more concise and readable
code in a functional way.

It is a work in progress, I will be adding more functions as I need them/as I have time.

Feel free to contribute. You can either contribute by adding functions, by adding tests or by adding documentation.

## To-Do:

Only functions that are themselves written and are unit tested are marked as done unless they are one-liners.
